# tdd-by-example
The aim of this repo is to track the progress I make through the reading of Ken Beck's book: _Test Driven Development: By Example_


## The TDD cycle followed consists in:

1. Add a little test
2. Run all tests and fail
3. Make a change
4. Run the tests and succeed
5. Refactor to remove duplication


## Keys when applying TDD are:

* The three approaches to making a test work cleanly: fake it, triangulation and obvious implementation 
* Removing duplication between test and code as a way to drive the design
* The ability to control the gap between tests to increase traction when the road gets slippery and cruise faster when conditions are clear
